    ℹ️ Information ℹ️
  </h3>
  <br>
  <span> Another e-commerce project, but this time in a group of 5 members. Viewing, consuming and adding products to the shopping cart, searching by categories or item names and among others. </span> 
  <br><br>
  <span> In this project we had one of React's biggest problems (especially for large scale applications), the communication of components with props. Using the prop drilling method, we had some difficulties to perform this communication, but we managed to achieve our goal with teamwork. </span>
